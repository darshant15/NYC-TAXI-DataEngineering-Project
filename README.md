# NYC Taxi Data Engineering Project (Data Engineering Pipeline + YouTube Overview)

This repository presents a complete **data engineering pipeline** built around the **NYC Taxi dataset**, capturing raw trip records and transforming them into analytics-ready data. You can also watch the data flow and pipeline demonstration through the embedded walkthrough video below.

##  Project Highlights

- **End-to-End Pipeline**  
  From raw NYC Taxi trip data ingestion → transformation → storage → querying and visualization.

- **Ingestion Methods**  
  Pull data from APIs or CSV sources and store it in a raw data zone (e.g., Data Lake or blob storage).

- **Data Transformation**  
  Clean, filter, deduplicate, and enrich the trip data using ETL tools or frameworks such as Python (pandas), PySpark, or cloud services.

- **Architectural Design**  
  Follow a layered architecture approach (e.g., Bronze/Silver/Gold, Medallion) to ensure data quality and analytics readiness.

- **Orchestration & Workflow Management**  
  Use tools like Airflow, Azure Data Factory, or Prefect to manage and automate pipeline execution, scheduling, and retries.

- **Analytics & Visualization**  
  Use SQL-based tools (BigQuery, Synapse, Redshift) or BI tools (Power BI, Tableau) to build interactive dashboards showing insights like trip distance patterns, fare distributions, and congestion maps.

- **Security & Governance**  
  Manage credentials securely (e.g., Key Vault, IAM), follow best practices for role-based access, and design for scalability and cost-efficiency.

##  Project Deliverables

1. **Raw Data Layer** — Storage of original taxi trip data in CSV / Parquet format.
2. **Processed Layer** — Cleaned and normalized data, ready for analysis.
3. **Analytics Layer** — Schema designed for BI, exposed via SQL queries.
4. **Dashboard** — Interactive visuals to explore trip insights and trends.
5. **Workflow** — Orchestrated ETL with automation and scheduling.

###  How to Run This Pipeline

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/darshant15/NYC-TAXI-DataEngineering-Project.git
    cd NYC-TAXI-DataEngineering-Project
    ```

2. Configure credentials (e.g., connection strings, keys) securely.

3. Launch ingestion workflow (via Cloud orchestration, local scripts, or notebooks).

4. Run transformation layers (either via Spark, Python, or SQL transformation scripts).

5. Load into your analytics layer (Synapse, Redshift, BigQuery, etc.) and connect your BI tool.

6. Explore insights via dashboard.
